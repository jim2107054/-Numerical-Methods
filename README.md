## Algorithms Used
Detailed explanations of each method are provided below:

- **Jacobi Iterative Method**: An iterative method for solving a system of linear equations.
- **Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method**: Another iterative approach that improves the solution obtained by the Jacobi method.
- **Gauss Elimination**: A method for solving linear equations by converting the system into an upper triangular matrix.
- **Gauss-Jordan Elimination**: An extension of Gauss elimination that reduces the matrix to its reduced row echelon form.
- **LU Factorization**: Decomposes a matrix as the product of a lower triangular and an upper triangular matrix.
- **Bisection Method**: A bracketing method for solving non-linear equations.
- **False Position Method**: A method similar to the bisection method but uses a secant line to better approximate the root.
- **Secant Method**: A root-finding algorithm that uses the secant of a curve to approximate the root.
- **Newton-Raphson Method**: A powerful method for solving non-linear equations using derivatives.
- **Runge-Kutta Method**: A method used for solving differential equations numerically.
